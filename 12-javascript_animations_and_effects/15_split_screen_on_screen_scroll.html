      <h2>Nuts: Small Foods with Big Benefits</h2>
      <p>
        Nuts are nutrient-dense foods that have been part of the human diet for
        thousands of years. Despite their small size, they are rich in healthy
        fats, protein, vitamins, and minerals, making them an excellent addition
        to a balanced diet.
      </p>
      <h3>Brazil Nuts</h3>
      <p>
        Brazilian nuts, also known as Brazil nuts, are native to the Amazon
        rainforest. They are especially famous for their extremely high selenium
        content, a mineral that plays a key role in thyroid function and
        supports the immune system. Just one or two Brazil nuts per day can
        provide the recommended daily intake of selenium.
      </p>
      <h3>Other Popular Nuts</h3>
      <p>
        Almonds are rich in vitamin E and are known to support skin and heart
        health. Walnuts contain omega-3 fatty acids, which help reduce
        inflammation and support brain function. Cashews provide important
        minerals such as magnesium and zinc, contributing to bone and muscle
        health.
      </p>
      <h3>Health Benefits</h3>
      <p>
        Regular consumption of nuts has been linked to improved heart health,
        better cholesterol levels, and reduced risk of chronic diseases.
        Although nuts are calorie-dense, they promote satiety and can help with
        weight management when eaten in moderation.
      </p>
      <p>
        In conclusion, nuts such as Brazilian nuts, almonds, walnuts, and
        cashews are powerful natural foods. When consumed responsibly, they
        offer a wide range of health benefits and add both nutrition and flavor
        to everyday meals.
